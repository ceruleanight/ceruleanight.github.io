I've searched for some more websites to upload my mixes to, and found a couple. I've added them all to the existing mixes. The two new main hosts being Audius and Audiomack. Unfortunately, audiomack likes to delete random ones so it won't be available for every mix, but I'll still try.

There's also hearthis.at, but they limit how much can be uploaded per week so if I remember they'll eventually be uploaded.

Anyway that's all for this update.

Have a happy spook day
