While I've been keeping the mixes up to date on this site, everything else has kinda been ignored. Especially the tab numbers at the bottom (those looked terrible).

But I've finally gone through and fixed up the CSS and added bootstrap. Which means the tab numbers at the bottom actually look nice now, yay.

Small update on the visual side of things, but hey it's something. Not that this is really a blogging site anyway, but I thought it's been well over a year so why not?
